_Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Josh Brown._

## Thanks for Checking Out My Quote Builder!
This is a lightweight tool that works in your web browser. I converted it from one of my web applications I developed in 2024 for a small business. The purpose of it is to help anyone quickly generate repair estimates, without the depression and clunkiness that comes with using spreadsheets.
With this app, you can:
- **Dynamically create text-based repair estimates**    
  - Add, reorder, and quickly duplicate an unlimited number of line items
  - Auto-calculate parts & labor taxes, shop-supplies charges, shipping, and include current bill adjustments
  - Instantly calculate retail pricing via the ‚ÄúMagic Box‚Äù engine
- **Generate two quotes simultaneously**: **Recommended** _and_ **Required**
- **Export/import your settings** (excluding hourly labor rates) to `.txt` (plain-text JSON)

I built this app using a blend of tools - **Vanilla JS**, **Bootstrap 5**, **SortableJS**, and **Font Awesome 6**.  
All settings persist in your browser‚Äôs `localStorage`.

## üöß Upgrading Safely & Storing Settings

> **Everything you configure‚ÄîGeneral Presets, Price Models & Hourly Labor Rates‚Äîlives only in your browser‚Äôs `localStorage`.**  
> Clearing cookies/site-data or loading a fresh copy will erase **all** your settings.

Backing up is **critical**, but easy:

1. **General Presets**  
   - Go to the **General Presets** tab.  
   - Click **Export General Presets** ‚áí download a `.txt` (JSON).  
   - After upgrading, re-import with **Import Presets**.

2. **Price Models**  
   - Switch to the **Price Models** tab.  
   - Click **Export Price Model** on any row ‚áí download its `.txt`.  
   - Re-import via **Import Price Model**.

3. **Hourly Labor Rates**  
   - _No export button._  
   - If lost, recreate under **Manage Presets ‚Üí Hourly Labor Rates ‚Üí Create New Hourly Labor Rate**.

> **Tip:** Store these JSON files in a safe place (cloud drive, password vault, etc.). A single import restores your entire workspace.
